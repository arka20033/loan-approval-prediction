 Loan Approval Prediction (Random Forest + XGBoost)

This project predicts loan approval status using an ensemble learning approach with Random Forest** and **XGBoost** classifiers.

 Features
- Data preprocessing (categorical encoding, column cleanup)
- Ensemble learning with Random Forest and XGBoost
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
- Visualization of model performance

Requirements
Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 Usage
Place the dataset in the `dataset/` directory, then run:

```bash
python loan_approval_xgb_rf.py
```

#Dataset
The project uses the [Loan Approval Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset).
